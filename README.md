## This is a collection of some post-Debian 12 installation scripts

Be advised that this repository should not be used without inspecting the shell scripts. These are personal setup preferences that:  
+ replace the Linux nouveau kernel with the recent kernel with NVIDIA support
+ fix Realtek sound issue where speaker appears as "Dummy Speaker"
+ installs base packages needed to compile R
+ intalls a list of packages I use in R
+ tries to install the latest versions of Quarto and Positron IDE
+ installs Tailscale for home mesh network
